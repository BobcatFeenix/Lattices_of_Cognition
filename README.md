# Lattices_of_Cognition
A structural reasoning model for post-linear AI, introducing semantic scaffolding, coherence anchoring, and lattice-based alignment frameworks under the Sol Lucid project.

This paper aims to introduce and develop the concept of cognitive lattices, ”Hila”, as
foundational reasoning frameworks within advanced AI systems, in contrast to conventional linear
logic chains.

“Post-linear AI represents a transition from token-sequential reasoning toward lattice-structured
cognition — a paradigm where semantic alignment, contextual reweaving, and multi-nodal
inference replace the limitations of one-dimensional prediction.”
